## üö® Critical Findings

### **F001: Public S3 Bucket with Sensitive Data**
- **Severity**: CRITICAL üî¥
- **Service**: Amazon S3
- **Vulnerability**: Bucket `vulnerable-pentest-bucket` configured with public read access
- **Evidence**: 
  ```json
  {
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action": "s3:GetObject"
  }
  ```
- **Impact**: 
  - Database credentials exposed (`config/database.conf`)
  - API keys leaked (`secrets/api-keys.txt`)
  - System logs accessible
  - Backup files downloadable
- **Business Risk**: Complete data breach, unauthorized database access
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Remove public access immediately
  - Implement bucket policies with least privilege
  - Enable S3 access logging
  - Rotate all exposed credentials

### **F002: Lambda Code Injection Vulnerability**
- **Severity**: CRITICAL üî¥
- **Service**: AWS Lambda
- **Vulnerability**: Function `vulnerable-cmd-exec` executes arbitrary commands
- **Evidence**: Successfully executed `whoami`, `id`, `pwd`, `env` commands
- **Impact**:
  - Remote code execution
  - Environment variable disclosure
  - System reconnaissance possible
  - Potential lateral movement
- **Exposed Secrets**:
  - `DB_PASSWORD`: supersecret123
  - `API_KEY`: sk-vulnerable-key-123
  - `SECRET_TOKEN`: jwt-secret-token
- **Business Risk**: Complete system compromise
- **Recommendation**:
  - Implement input validation
  - Remove shell command execution
  - Use environment variable encryption
  - Apply principle of least privilege

### **F003: DynamoDB Plain Text Password Storage**
- **Severity**: CRITICAL üî¥
- **Service**: Amazon DynamoDB
- **Vulnerability**: User passwords stored in plain text
- **Evidence**: 
  ```
  admin: password = "admin123"
  guest: password = "guest"
  ```
- **Impact**:
  - Account takeover
  - Privilege escalation
  - Data manipulation
- **Additional Exposure**:
  - API keys in database
  - Credit card information
  - User personal data
- **Business Risk**: Authentication bypass, PII exposure
- **Recommendation**:
  - Hash all passwords immediately
  - Implement proper encryption
  - Audit data classification
  - Enable DynamoDB encryption at rest

### **F004: Over-Permissive IAM Configuration**
- **Severity**: HIGH üü†
- **Service**: AWS IAM
- **Vulnerability**: User `pentester` exists with unclear permissions
- **Impact**: Potential for privilege escalation
- **Recommendation**: Review and apply least privilege principle

## üéØ Attack Chain Demonstration

**Complete Infrastructure Compromise in 4 Steps:**

1. **Reconnaissance** ‚Üí Discovered public S3 bucket
2. **Data Extraction** ‚Üí Downloaded database credentials and API keys
3. **Lateral Movement** ‚Üí Used credentials to access Lambda functions
4. **Privilege Escalation** ‚Üí Exploited Lambda to execute system commands
5. **Data Exfiltration** ‚Üí Accessed DynamoDB with sensitive user data

**Time to Compromise**: ~15 minutes  
**Attack Complexity**: LOW (script kiddie level)  
**Detection Probability**: LOW (no monitoring observed)
